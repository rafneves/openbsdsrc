# Add pledge(2) to nl(1)

**The [nl(1)](http://man.openbsd.org/nl) change was accepted and [commited](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=155580893717963&w=2). This branch is closed.**

This is my personal working copy of OpenBSD source tree. It is solely used to keep my proposed changes until I submit them to OpenBSD project. 
They may be accepted by OpenBSD developers or not.

You **must not** use it as replacement of [official sets](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download) or [source tree](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/). There is no guarantee that this **even** compiles.
