# Add DUID support to -P option of mount_mfs(8)

This is my personal working copy of OpenBSD source tree. It is solely used to keep my proposed changes until I submit them to OpenBSD project. 
They may be accepted by OpenBSD developers or not.

You **must not** use it as replacement of [official sets](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download) or [source tree](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/). There is no guarantee that this **even** compiles.

If you want more information about OpenBSD or related projects, see https://www.openbsd.org.
